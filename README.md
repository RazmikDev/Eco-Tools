But sometimes they can cause performance problems when they, for example, are passed to methods that accepts only Object or interface parameters.Boxing is a big problem of high-loaded applications cause it produces a lot of objects in heap that then will be collected by GC. Unintended load to GC leaves less CPU resources for payload.Sometimes it's very complicated to avoid unnecessary boxing when using external libraries or heavily modifiable code.`BoxedValuesCache` class provides a global cache of boxed structure. Each structure that needs to be boxed multiple times can be boxed just once which incredibly decrease GC load and memory consumption in some cases.Also the `Box()` extension method is available for all structures that implements `IEquatable<T>` interface.```Int32 x = 25;Object xBoxed1 = x.Box();Object xBoxed2 = x.Box();(xBoxed1 == xBoxed2) // is true```### Recycle Factories*description will be available soon* ## Tools & Extensions ### Limited collections*description will be available soon*### Thread-local storage*description will be available soon*### Time extensions*description will be available soon*
